# Lane Detection System - Advanced Improvements

## Initial Issues Fixed

1. **Video Path Issue**:
   - Line 92: `video_path = "Sample_video"` - This doesn't match the actual file in the workspace which is "sampleVideo.mp4"
   - **Fix**: Changed to `video_path = "sampleVideo.mp4"`

2. **Output File Name Issue**:
   - Line 97: Writes to "output_lane_stable.mp4" but the file in the workspace is "Output_Lane_det.mp4"
   - **Fix**: Changed to `out = cv2.VideoWriter("Output_Lane_det.mp4", fourcc, 20.0, (int(cap.get(3)), int(cap.get(4))))`

## Advanced Lane Detection Improvements

After extensive testing and optimization, the lane detection quality was significantly improved with the following advanced enhancements:

### 1. Adaptive Region of Interest
- Implemented a more adaptive region of interest using percentage-based calculations
- Bottom width is 95% of image width to capture more of the road
- Top width is 50% of image width for better perspective handling
- Height starts at 60% of the image height to focus on the relevant road area

### 2. Multi-Color Space Processing
- Implemented processing in multiple color spaces (HLS, HSV, LAB) for better feature extraction
- HLS color space for white line detection
- HSV color space for yellow line detection
- LAB color space for enhanced yellow line detection (b channel)
- Combined masks from different color spaces for more robust lane marking detection

### 3. Enhanced Image Processing Pipeline
- Added histogram equalization to improve contrast
- Increased Gaussian blur kernel size to (9, 9) for better noise reduction
- Optimized Canny edge detection thresholds (40, 120)
- Added edge dilation to connect nearby edges
- Implemented a 10-step preprocessing pipeline for comprehensive lane detection

### 4. Advanced Hough Transform Configuration
- Optimized Hough transform parameters:
  - Reduced threshold to 40 to detect more lines
  - Reduced minLineLength to 20 to capture shorter line segments
  - Increased maxLineGap to 300 to connect nearby line segments
- Added detailed parameter documentation for better understanding

### 5. Robust Line Detection and Filtering
- Implemented fallback mechanisms when no lines are detected
- Added more permissive slope thresholds (0.15 to 2.5) to capture more potential lane lines
- Allowed lines slightly past or before the center for better detection in curves
- Added multiple fallback strategies for line averaging
- Implemented a two-tier fallback system for robust line detection

### 6. Improved Visualization and Debugging
- Added confidence indicator based on history buffer fullness
- Created optional visualization layers for debugging:
  - Lane mask visualization
  - Edge detection visualization
  - All detected lines visualization
- Added turn severity detection (Sharp Left/Right Turn)
- Slowed down video playback for better visualization (30ms delay)

### 7. Error Handling and Robustness
- Added comprehensive error handling throughout the pipeline
- Implemented relaxed conditions for drawing the green lane area
- Added try-except blocks to handle edge cases
- Created fallback mechanisms for all critical processing steps

## Required Dependencies

The lane detection system requires the following dependencies:

1. **Python**: The code is written in Python
2. **OpenCV (cv2)**: Used for image processing, video handling, and computer vision algorithms
3. **NumPy**: Used for numerical operations and array handling
4. **collections.deque**: Part of the Python standard library, used for maintaining a history of lane lines

## Running the System

The system can be run by executing the lanedet.py script:

```bash
python lanedet.py
```

This will:
1. Read frames from the input video (sampleVideo.mp4)
2. Process each frame using the advanced lane detection pipeline
3. Display the processed frames with lane detection, turning direction, and confidence indicator
4. Write the processed frames to an output video file (Output_Lane_det.mp4)
5. Exit when the video ends or when 'q' is pressed

## Performance Considerations

The advanced lane detection system is more computationally intensive due to:
- Processing in multiple color spaces
- More complex preprocessing pipeline
- Additional visualization layers

However, the improved detection quality and robustness justify the increased computational cost.
